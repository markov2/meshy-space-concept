<h1>Roles</h1>

<p>Meshy Space base object <SCHEMA>ms:unit</SCHEMA> has many relations.
The client MAY understand these relations.  The relations have a Role,
and end in a unit of a certain <a href="types.html">Type</a>.
See also the <a href="/schemas/base/constants/roles.html">base Roles</a>.</p>

<p>The <code>ms:is</code> attribute of the <SCHEMA>ms:has</SCHEMA> elements
in a <SCHEMA>ms:unit</SCHEMA> describe the relation.  When that value
is in the <code>msc:</code> namespace, you will find it described below.</p>

<div id="roles" class="accordion constants">

<h3>msc:Role/Author</h3>
<div>
  <p>Refers to a <SCHEMA>msc:Type/Identity</SCHEMA>.
    Who or which process has created the payload for this unit (may be more
    than one).  Although optional, this may be very useful for debugging.
    It is also required for licenses to be active.  Defaults to the
    Creator of the parent.</p>
</div>

<h3>msc:Role/BasedOn</h3>
<div>
  <p>To be able to produce this unit, other units where used.  For instance,
    when this is compiled code, it may refer to the source code.  It may
    also refer to units which describe the configuration of tools which were
    used, or servers where the production was run.<br />
    It MAY be useful to inspect the units where your parent is based on.</p>
</div>

<h3>msc:Role/Breaks</h3>
<div>
  <p>Signals that the application of this unit will break the application
    of other units, when they are in use in your environment.  Administrator
    intervention or a <code>--force</code> may be needed to decide whether
    to proceed.</p>
</div>

<h3>msc:Role/Contains</h3>
<div>
  <p>The reverse of the parent relation: it may refer to itself,
    or to units one level lower in the data structure defined by the
    <i>Concept</i>.<br />
    For instance, a unit of type <SCHEMA>msc:Role/Collection</SCHEMA>
    contains Collection sub-sets, but also Products and Actions.  It will not
    contain Stores.</p>
</div>

<h3>msc:Role/Follows</h3>
<div>
  <p>This unit is a logical follow-up of the referred unit(s).  For
    instance, a previous document version or a previous software
    release.<br />
    The unit's <SCHEMA>ms:revision</SCHEMA> is not to be used to manage
    releases: the newest revision is the <i>only</i> valid state of the
    unit.  There are no parallel unit revisions in the same space.<br />
    It is the client's choice whether takes an action when it receives a 
    unit which follows some other unit.  A deprecation of the previous
    version may happen soon to force actions.</p>
</div>

<h3>msc:Role/Owner</h3>
<div>
  <p>Refers to a <SCHEMA>msc:Type/Identity</SCHEMA>.
    The owner, possibly more than one, has special access rules
    to the unit.  This defaults to the owner(s) of the parent
    unit.  Either you list all owners, or use the default: you cannot
    selectively take a sub-set of owners of the parent.</p>
</div>

<h3>msc:Role/Publisher</h3>
<div>
  <p>Refers to a <SCHEMA>msc:Type/Identity</SCHEMA>.
    Who or which process has connected this unit to its parent: has made
    this unit visible.<br>
    Units MAY get re-published: have more than one Publisher.  For instance,
    when someone feels that they need to be repackaged, signed with a
    stronger algorithm, and so on.  In such case, it is RECOMMENDED to keep
    reference to the original Publisher.</p>
</div>

<h3>msc:Role/Replaces<h3>
<div>
  <p>A bit stronger than simply 'Follows': the receiving party is advised
    to remove the other unit when it is in use.  What will need to happen
    to achieve it, is outside the scope of Meshy Space (unless the unit
    is a <SCHEMA>msc:Type/</SCHEMA>)</p>
</div>

<h3>msc:Role/Requires<h3>
<div>
  <p>Used to optimize the exchange of units: inform the client to request
    for other units before attempting to use the content of this unit.
    (Expect bi-directional dependencies).  The requirements may refer to
    software configurations or system names.<br>
    The when attribute of the <SCHEMA>ms:has</SCHEMA>
    relation may help you in very convenient ways.</p>
</div>

<h3>msc:Role/Rules</h3>
<div>
  <p>Refers to <SCHEMA>msc:Type/Rules</SCHEMA>.
    Defaults to the rules of the parent unit.  The referred
    rule-set describes who can access which relations, and who can
    take which actions on the unit.  One unit SHALL have no more than
    one rule relation, but rule role units MAY be nested.</p>
</div>

<h3>msc:Role/Wallet</h3>
<div>
  <p>Refers to <SCHEMA>msc:Type/Collection</SCHEMA>, which contains the
    secret components of your Identities.  The Rules of a Wallet are
    by default more strict than for normal collections.  It is crucial
    enough to give such collection its own Role.</p>
