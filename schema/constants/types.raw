<h1>Types</h2>

<p>The Meshy Space base object <SCHEMA>ms:unit</SCHEMA> is extremely flexible,
but not expressive.  The <i>Concept</i> defines (mime like) types of units, which
explain the role of the unit in the concept.</p>

<p>At the moment, these are the types you can expect: (sorted alphabetically)</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>msc:Type.Collection</code></dt>
<dd>Mainly contains products (units with data managed by other applications).
    It may contain information how to mirror the data and the meta-data.
    (Computer people call Collections "directories" or "Drive")
</dd>

<dt><code>msc:Type.Company</code></dt>
<dd>Groups all activities of a legal entity, like a company, foundation,
    or person.  It will publish public (anonymized) identities of personnel,
    and contact information.  Also, it will "open" Stores per main activity.
    Deparments are Companies contained inside other Companies.
</dd>

<dt><code>msc:Type.Identity</code></dt>
<dd>This represents a public view of a person, company or organisation.
    As a person, you may want to create many Identities, for verious
    roles you have in society.  When an Identity contains other Identities,
    it behaves like a group.  Even system processes have identities, which
    allow them to sign their processing results.
    (Computer people call Identities usually "login" or "certificate").
</dd>

<dt><code>msc:Type.Resource</code></dt>
<dd>Describes to get to data storage.  The data is octets which are probably
    packed and compressed.  It may be part of a larger resource.
    (Computer people call Resources "files", "archives" or "zips")
</dd>

<dt><code>msc:Type.Rules<code></dt>
<dd>Most units have access restrictions: read, create, update, deprecate,
    expire, and so on, which are specified in a rule-set.
    (Computer people call this "permissions" or "access control lists")
</dd>

<dt><code>msc:Type.Scribe</code></dt>
<dd>Configuration of Collection management process, as executed by the
    Town hall.  Each Scribe needs to run often, RECOMMENDED at least every
    hour.  But it is also used to retrieve units from remove Towns.  It
    implements the unit's life-cycle.
</dd>

<dt><code>msc:Type.Store</code></dt>
<dd>Groups Collections which relate to one activity of a Company: documentation,
    input data, output data, actions, history.
    (Computer people call Stores "disk", "mirrors" or "shares")
</dd>

<dt><code>msc:Type.Town</code></dt>
<dd>Main control unit for a Meshy Space instance.  It manages multiple
    namespaces which it has registered for companies and people.
    It implements the life-cycle of the units.  The Town contains Stores.
    (Computer people call Towns confusingly "servers")
</dd>
</dl>
