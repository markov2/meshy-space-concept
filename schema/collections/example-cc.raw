<h1>Example complex data archives</h1>

<p>Meshy Space can be used to pass complex packaged data, where the
client must actively download (or upload) data, preferrably in bulk.
This page shows how a real-life very large data-sets can be denoted.</p>

<p><b>Be aware</b> that this design only works well (on bulk data) when
the definitions are heavily cached between calls and processes.  It is
RECOMMENDED to heavily cache definitions, but mind the expiration!</p>

<h4>CommonCrawl publications</h4>

<p>Open web-crawler organisation <a href="http://commoncrawl.org">CommonCrawl</a>
monthly crawls a part of internet and publishes the results in huge
WARC files.  Besides, it makes various derivative products.  Together
in the order of 200,000 files with a total of 500TB of uncompressed
information per month.</p>

<p>Access to these files in one of the first implementations of Meshy
Space Interfaces, so a good example how complex it can get!</p>

<h2>Store</h2>

<p>The <i>publications</i> manage large quantities of data.  Often &mdash;like
in this example&mdash; it is purely data files, kept on big disks.
However, it may also be dynamically created data.  Usually, one service
has very few publications (otherwise, your service is doing too much).</p>

<p class="list">CommonCrawl publishes three interfaces:<p>
<ul>
<li>via S3 (using <code>aws s3 cp ...</code>),</li>
<li>via HTTP (you need to know the names), and</li>
<li>via a search page (to get separate crawl records).</li>
</ul>

<p>For the first two, the presented structure is exactly the same.
The third is very different (and not specified in this example)</p>

<p>The following publication definitions reflect the variety of interfaces.
The configuration is part of the store definition:</p>
<XML>
<b:unit b:id="shop">
  <b:type>msc:Role/Store</b:type>
  <b:fetch b:base="s3:"    />
  <b:fetch b:base="http://aws"  />
  <b:has b:ref="cc:index" b:is="msc:Role/Collection" />
</b:unit>
<b:unit b:id="cc:s3">
  <b:type="msc:Role/Resource">
  <b:resource>
     <b:entry>s3://commoncrawl</b:entry>
  </b:resource>
  <b:has b:ref="cc:crawl-data" b:is="msc:Role/Collection" />
</b:unit>
<b:unit b:id="cc:http">
  <b:type="msc:Role/Resource">
  <b:resource>
     <b:entry>https://commoncrawl.s3.amazonaws.com</b:entry>
  </b:resource>
  <b:has b:ref="cc:crawl-data" b:is="msc:Role/Collection" />
</b:unit>
<b:unit b:id="cc:index">
  <b:entry>s3://commoncrawl/cc-index/table/cc-main/warc/</b:entry>
</b:unit>
</XML>

<p>The <code>address</code> URIs may contain access information,
like username and password.  There are many URI schemes, see the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_URI_schemes">list of URI
schemas on Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>The publication alternatives may have different restrictions: access time,
price, speed, physical location.  And, of course, the client may not
support some of the offered protocols.</p>

<h2>Collections</h2>

<p>In a <i>publication</i>, you find <i>collections</i>.  Each collection is a
logically coherent set of products.  You can compare them with directories
(maps) and archives (tar, zip).  Actually: they are implemented as
directories and archives!  The academic difference is that a "collection"
is an abstract notion: a set of data products.  The concept design is
more important than the implementation details</p>

<XML>
<!-- in namespace cc: -->
<b:unit b:id="">
  <b:type>ms:Type/Namespace</b:type>
  <b:use b:prefix="cc" />   <!-- refers to me -->
  <b:namespace>
    <b:manager>server-config</b:manager>
    <b:fetch b:base="s3://commoncrawl/" />
    <b:fetch b:base="https://commoncrawl.s3.amazonaws.com/" />
  </b:namespace>
</b:unit>

<b:unit b:id="server-config">
  <b:type>msc:Type/Shop</ms.type>
  <c:shop>
  </c:shop>
  <b:has my:is="msc:Type/Collection" b:ref="2020dec-crawl" />
  <b:has my:is="msc:Type/Collection" b:ref="2021jan-crawl" />
  <b:has my:is="msc:Type/Collection" b:ref="2021feb-crawl" />
  <!-- and hundreds more -->
</b:unit>
</XML>

<p>Collections can contain sub-collections, like a directory can contain
sub-directories or a zip-file may contain zip-files.  In the example
above, you can read that each month a separate crawl collection is
produced as new part in the full collection.</p>

<p>All crawl sets are "replicated" to both publication locations (actually
they are two interfaces to the same bytes).  In our case, the data found
on both places is exactly the same.  The client can decide which one to take.
They may differ in cost, or speed, or protocol support, or jurisdiction of
the server, or...</p>

<p>It would be possible to have different structures for the same
data in different collections, or even in the same collection: see the
<i>product</i> as explained below.</p>

<p>The <code>address</code>es are relative URIs: they are relative to
the address of the parent collection, or in this case the publication base
address.  You may use any kind of relative addressing which your URI
scheme supports, or use absolute addresses.
Mind that you SHALL put a trailing slash on directories!</p>

<p>The collection refers to the publication, and the publication to the
collection: you MAY NEED to dynamicly ask the service for missing details,
therefore this is a double-linked list.  The number of collections is
usually small compared to the amount of products included in them.</p>

<h2>Sub-collections</h2>

<p>In the case of CommonCrawl publications, each month a bunch of
different data fragments are produced.  Logically, on web-page can
be seen as one product.  The logs, extracted text and detected language
can be seen as parts of that product. Following any Object model, this
should mimic:</p>
<PERL>
$page = $collection->product($some_url);
print $page->part('log');
$words = $page->part('text')->word_count;
</PERL>

<p>It is very well possible you prefer an other structure for products
and parts.  That are choice you make for your data.</p>

<XML>
<b:unit b:id="2021feb">
  <b:type>ms:Type/Namespace</b:type>
  <b:namespace>
    <b:fetch b:base="CC-MAIN-2021-10/" />
  </b:namespace>
</b:unit>

<b:unit b:id=
  <b:type>msc:Type/Collection</b:type>
  <b:collection>
  </b:resource>
  </b:collection>
  <b:has b:ref="2021feb-crawl" />
  <b:has b:ref="2021feb-metadata" />  <!-- WAT files -->
  <b:has b:ref="2021feb-texts" />     <!-- WET files -->
</b:unit>
</XML>

<p>The different parts all have their own sub-collection.  They do
not need to be published at the same time.  As any structural component,
you can use <code>version</code>, <code>expires</code> etc to get the
client to update its cached information about a collection.</p>

<p>The collection may also maintain various useful statistics, like the
total <code>size</code> of the stored information.  This MAY BE
static information.</p>

<h2>Directory containing archive files</h2>

<p>On a certain nesting of collections, you will shift from representing
physical directories into representing packaged product parts (optional).</p>
<XML>
<b:unit b:id="2021-10">
  <b:type>msc:Type/Namespace</b:type>
  <b:namespace />
    <b:fetch b:base="CC-MAIN-2021-10/segments/" />
  </b:namespace>
  <b:has b:is="warc:Type/Archive" b:ref="2021-10/00000" />
  <b:has b:is="warc:Type/Archive" b:ref="2021-10/00001" />
     <!-- and 78000 more -->
</b:unit>
</XML>

<p>The absolute address for this set is already getting quite long
<code>s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2021-10/segments/</code></p>

<h2>Archive files with product parts</h2>

<p>Finally something which stores bytes.  However, it's still all
declarive and abstract.</p>

<XML>
<b:unit b:id="202102warc-00000">
  <b:type>msc:Type/Collection</b:type>
  <b:content>
    <b:type>warc:Type/Archive</b:type>
    <b:size>1063809923</b:size>
    <b:packaged b:by="b:Pack/GzipMultiStream">
      <b:fetch b:ref="2021feb-crawl">
      <b:entry>1614178347293.1/warc/CC-MAIN-2021022-00000.warc.gz</b:entry>
    </b:packaged>
  </b:content>
</b:unit>
</XML>

<p>WARC files use extension <code>.warc.gz</code>, but we warned that
each "record" is separately compressed with gzip.  Each crawled web-page
produces three records: a metadata, a request, and a response. Probably in
the same warc file.</p>

<p>You may be tempted to say that there is a meaning to
<code>cc-s3/crawl-data/2021feb/2021feb-crawl/202102warc-00000</code> but
there is none: there are multiple paths from data items towards publication
and they are not equivalent.  The sequence of IDs, and even the IDs should
not be used anywhere.  All IDs are unique, hence uniquely referencing a
unit of configuration.</p>

<h2>Products</h2>

<p>Only at the bottom of a collection structure, we find real bytes.
But that's not important.  Crucial is that the server has homogeneous
units &mdash;items&mdash; prepared for the client.  Those logic
<code>items</code> collect their knowledge from the fastest and cheapest
sources, and only when they need to.</p>

<p>With url (here used as <code>name</code>) one can get structured crawl
information, extracted text (optional), extracted links, and more.</p>

<h2>Placement</h2>

<p>The <i>publication</i> and <i>collection</i> definitions are 
cached over client-server connections, typically for a day.  They will
usually be put staticly in the service definition.  However, when the
service is very large (as in this example), they may also be included
on need-to-know basis.</p>

<p>The <i>products</i> and their parts are provided in response
to queries.  They are part of the payload, and as such may be
distributed inlined, or as bulk via publications.</p>
