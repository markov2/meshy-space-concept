<h1>Meshy Space Concept (MSC) schema</h1>

<p>The <i>concept</i> (preferred namespace prefix <code>msc:</code>) is
implemented on top of the <i>Meshy Space Interfaces</i> (MSI) structures
(<a href="../base/">namespace prefix <code>ms:</code></a>), just like
your own projects can be implemented on top that infrastructure or on
the Concept.</p>

<p>The Concept uses administration which is maintained in
<SCHEMA>ms:unit</SCHEMA> elements of certain types within the
<code>msc:Role.</code> namespace.  But there are units of other types
as well.  Where units are like "object", objects have different purposes
and that expects certain relations with other "objects". The roles
indicate what to expect, and sometimes add a little extra.</p>

<h2>Overview of the Concept</h2>

<p>You first connect to an existing <i>server</i> (usually a daemon
on your own system) to get your own working-space.  You get your own
(private) namespace, like a login.  Within your namespace, you add your
<i>identities</i>, your private data-<i>collections</i>, and a cache of
units retrieved from other people's data-collections.</p>

<p>When you have information to share, you start (with one of your
public identities) a data-collection in a new namespace.  On the highest
level, you start with a <i>company</i> which represents the responsible
organisational entity (company, foundation, person).  Companies have a
collection of <i>stores</i>, which each represent different activities
(shop, department, project).  On their turn, stores are composed
of <i>collections</i>, which group strongly related information.
Collections may have sub-collections, and so on.  Somewhere down there
are <i>products</i> which contain the information which is the real data,
foreign to the concept.  For instance, images and data-files are produced
by external programs hence referred to as products.</p>
